My working solutions for the Code Challenges in the Demo Assessment once provided by [Qualified](http://qualified.io) to candidates as a Test Drive.  Feel free to refactor and contribute to my non-official solutions (those within the `non-official` folder) as long as your "refactored" solution does not break any of the existing tests.  Unfortunately, for the official solutions (`coffeescript`, `csharp`, `java`, `javascript`, `python` and `ruby`), I will no longer accept contributions as I no longer have access to the test cases.
